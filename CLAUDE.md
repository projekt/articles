# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a technical documentation repository containing comprehensive articles about Dart programming concepts. The repository focuses on educational content rather than executable code.

## Repository Structure

- **Root directory**: Contains markdown articles as primary content
- **dart_null_safety_FINAL_with_TOC.md**: Comprehensive guide on Dart's sound null safety system, including real-world examples, diagrams, and migration strategies
- **programming_paradigms_article.md**: Educational article covering programming paradigms (Imperative, OOP, Functional, Declarative, Procedural) with Dart examples

## Working with Articles

The articles are structured with:
- Table of Contents at the beginning
- Executive Summary sections
- Real-world examples and analogies
- Code snippets in Dart
- Visual diagram references (though image files are gitignored)

When editing articles:
- Maintain the existing ToC structure and formatting
- Keep executive summaries concise and informative
- Preserve code example formatting and syntax
- Ensure real-world analogies align with technical concepts

## Git Workflow

Standard git operations apply. The repository uses:
- Main branch: `main`
- License: GNU GPL v3 (see LICENSE file)

## Ignored Content

The `.gitignore` excludes:
- macOS metadata files (`._**`, `.DS_Store`)
